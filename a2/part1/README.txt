Collaborated with Daniel Z. and Rylan C.

scheduler.c manages tasks by a cooperative scheduling method. This makes sure only one task is running at a time while the others are ready for an opening, sleeping, or waiting (blocked).

Did not have time to edit the scheduler to get worm running. It just seg faults.
